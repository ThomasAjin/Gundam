	The RX-78-2 Gundam Japanese: RX-78-2 ガンダム, Hepburn: Āru Ekkusu Nanajū Hachi no Ni Gandamu is a fictional manned robot (mecha), introduced in 1979 in Yoshiyuki Tomino's and Sunrise's anime series Mobile Suit Gundam. 
	In the series, it is a prototype weapon for the Earth Federation when it falls into the hands of Amuro Ray, the son of its designer in story (Tem Ray), 
	who goes on to pilot it in the Earth Federation's war against the Principality of Zeon.
	As the success of the series began the Gundam franchise, the robot's design was the first of many variations in subsequent works. 
	The design appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam serves as the symbol of the Gundam franchise and sparked the creation of its multiple sequels and spinoffs; Most future Gundams featured use the RX-78-2's color scheme and shape.

		<p Text-align:center class="big">The Yatate team combined the English word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to form the portmanteau Gundom. 
	Tomino changed it to Gundam, suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies like a hydroelectric dam holding back water.

			<p class="big">These technologies first debuted in Gundam Century, written by fans at that time, later endorsed by Sunrise and Bandai, and some of the authors of the articles within Gundam Century became official editors and writers of Gundam mechanics. 
				Later, following the trend of militaristic and technological interest in the community, Gundam Sentinel Special Edition included a section called imidam 0093 (Innovative Mobile Suit Information Dictionary, Annual Series, intentionally using an m at the end to reference Gundam), subtitled Basic Knowledge of Gundam Mechanics. 
				
	
	
		It offered a robot sci-fi depiction of conflicts in outer space with hundreds of soon-to-be classic protagonists and antagonists.</p></div>

		SD Gundam originated from a contributed illustration of a junior student from Nagoya by the name of Koji Yokoi to the "Model News" magazine that Bandai was issuing in the 1980s. The illustration is of a Gundam but with an unusual proportion where the overall height of the Gundam is equal to twice that of its head. This illustration interested the chief editor and led to Koji Yokoi serializing SD Gundam in 4 frame comics in "Model News".

		The super deformed designs were suitable for capsule toys, and so they were first merchandised as small SD Gundam-shaped erasers as part of the Gashapon series SD Gundam World in 1985. Built with a hole so they could be skewered into a pencil, the series was a hit with Japanese schoolchildren, and the concept soon expanded to other forms of merchandising and media, including models, manga, trading cards, anime and video games.
		
		The popularity of SD Gundam was such that between the late '80s and early '90s, sales from the SD Gundam franchise far exceeded the rest of Gundam.[2] And whereas Gundam pioneered the real robot branch of mecha anime, SD Gundam's more comical and exaggerated approach to the genre served to move it away from the ultra-realism that it was shifting towards in the '80s, and inspired a new flood of super-deformed robot shows between the late '80s and early '90s such as Sunrise's Mashin Hero Wataru, Madö King Granzört and Haō Taikei Ryū Knight, as well as video games such as the Super Robot Wars franchise.
		
		Although the SD Gundam franchise initially started out featuring characters and mecha from the mainstream Gundam series, by the 1990s SD Gundam spawned numerous spin-off series, SD Gundam Sengokuden (Musha Gundam) which has a Sengoku setting, SD Gundam Gaiden (Knight Gundam) which has a fantasy medieval setting and SD Command Chronicles which has a modern military style to name a few.
